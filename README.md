## Summary

This code is adapted from Mesa code for project "Virus on Network" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectmesa/mesa/master/examples/virus_on_network

In turn, this model is based on the NetLogo model "Virus on Network".

For more information about this model, read the NetLogo's web page: http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/VirusonaNetwork.
